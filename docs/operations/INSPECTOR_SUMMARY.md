## 🔧 Problem Detection & Resolution

### **Automatic Issue Detection**
The inspector automatically identifies:
- Missing Docker containers
- Database connection failures  
- Missing pgvector extension
- Ollama model availability
- Agent processing failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Resource constraints
- Security misconfigurations

### **Actionable Suggestions**
For every issue detected, specific fixes are provided:
```bash
💡 Suggestions:
  • Install pgvector: CREATE EXTENSION vector;
  • Pull model: docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull qwen2.5:latest
  • Restart Redis: docker-compose restart redis
  • Generate new JWT secret: openssl rand -hex 64
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### **Quick Health Check**
```bash
./agentcare-inspector.sh
# Comprehensive 37-point inspection with health score
```

### **CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Automated testing in pipelines
./agentcare-inspector.sh --quiet
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo "Health check failed"; exit 1; fi
```

### **Monitoring & Alerting**
```bash
# Cron job for regular monitoring
0 */6 * * * /path/to/agentcare-inspector.sh >> /var/log/agentcare-health.log
```

### **Troubleshooting Mode**
```bash
# Focus on errors only
./agentcare-inspector.sh --quiet

# Save detailed diagnostics  
./agentcare-inspector.sh > health-check-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
```
